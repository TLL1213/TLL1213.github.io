I am a master's student currently studying at Guizhou University. I am a member of the Text Computing and Cognitive Intelligence Engineering Research Center of the National Education Ministry. I graduated from Guizhou University with a bachelor's degree in 2023.

My main research focuses on deep learning related technologies, mainly involving controllable generation techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs). The main task of my research is Chinese Grammar Correction (CGEC). In addition, I am interested in many related technologies of LLM, such as quantification, agents, RAG, etc.

(Note: My personal blog is still being improved, and many parts are still template content that has not been changed yet.)

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
